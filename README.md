Checkstyle
=

This is an Apex implementation of [Checkstyle](https://github.com/checkstyle/checkstyle).  This implementation is still **VERY VERY VERY** much in it's infancy.  It may eat your babies if you leave it alone with them.  While some of the base parsing works, it's not yet usable for real code.
